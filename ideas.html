                        <p>Valparaíso, a coastal city in the fifth region of Chile, was a crucial port in 1900, marking an early stage of globalization. The historic center, known as "El Plan," houses markets, facilities, and the transportation system. Today, many historic buildings are in disrepair and abandoned, primarily due to fires caused by the age of their materials. The city has a unique topography: the port and center are in flat areas, while the population is concentrated in over 40 surrounding hills with old buildings and informal settlements, vulnerable to fires. The project proposes repurposing the shells of abandoned buildings for affordable rental housing, managed by government institutions. The income would be used for the city's heritage conservation.</p>

                        <p>During the pandemic, many people in Valparaíso faced significant challenges, especially those living in the hills, due to the difficulty of accessing markets in the city's plan. One opportunity was to use neighborhood courts as available land. A modular device, built with CLT and wooden slats, is proposed to function as a community cabinet. This device would house equipment for open-air markets, exhibitions, and projections, allowing deployment and retraction according to the residents' needs. Although the pandemic has ended, this device remains useful for people with reduced mobility.</p>

                        <p>In 2020, identifying habitability issues in the "Un Nuevo Amanecer" settlement, we, as socially committed architects, decided to contribute our skills. We collaborated with the community, naming streets and designing a map to strengthen their connection to the environment. In partnership with INJUV, we created a project to improve the children's play area by installing a sunshade, aiming to enhance quality of life and encourage community participation. We recognize that these actions are temporary solutions and that land squatting is not a long-term answer. We advocate for comprehensive approaches that develop inclusive housing policies and address the underlying causes of homelessness.</p>
