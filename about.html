<p>We are Paz Yolín and Patricio Muñoz, architects graduated from the University of Chile, dedicated to unveiling and transforming urban realities. 
  Currently, we reside in the New York City, where we face a variety of challenges while learning from this diverse metropolis. Together, we work at
   the Fundación Obra Común in Chile, with Paz as Vice President and Patricio as Executive Director, both deeply committed to urban well-being.
  Our website has a clear mission: to provide a realistic urban critique while generating innovative proposals to turn "non-desirable" cities into the 
  "cities we desire." At Non-Desirable Scapes, we explore "scapes that will be and those we do not desire."
  Patricio Muñoz, in addition to being an architect, holds a Master's in Urban Planning from the University of Chile and is currently pursuing a Master's 
  in Architecture and Urban Design at GSAPP, Columbia University. Paz Yolín, also an architect, is the owner of "La Tendalá."
  Here, you will find in-depth analyses and visionary proposals, always presented in a friendly and professional manner. We want to share our ideas and visions 
  with you, inspire positive changes, and together, build better cities.<p></p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting and being part of this!<p></p>
