                    <p>Urban landscapes are constantly changing. The city we live in today is not the same as it was 50 years ago, or even 25 years ago. We are at a crucial moment, where we can look at the recent past and project the near future. Non-desirable scapes seeks to understand how our cities have evolved and where they are headed.</p>
                    <p>Since 2000, the metropolitan region has undergone significant transformations. Initiatives such as metro expansion, highways, commerce, work, and housing have radically changed the urban landscape. These projects have aimed to improve quality of life, profitability, and city development. However, these transformations do not occur in a vacuum. They are intrinsically linked to global and local contexts.</p>
                    <p>The materials used in the construction of our cities come from various parts of the world, creating new landscapes of extraction and transformation. Gravel extraction pits and seaports loaded with materials are landscapes that reflect urban demand and our dependence on external resources. These landscapes compel us to consider the environmental and social implications of our development decisions. The cities of the future are projected to be sustainable, green, and smart. However, it is crucial to question how sustainable these initiatives truly are and to assess their global environmental impact.</p>
                    <p>In Santiago, Chile, the transformations of the last 25 years have been profound. The city has experienced significant changes in mobility, housing, and the emergence of new infrastructures. But it has also faced challenges such as the loss of natural landscapes and evident glacier melting. These visible transformations allow us to foresee what the landscape will be like in 2050 and what types of landscapes we desire and the landscapes that will be and those we don't desire</p>
                    <p>The aim of this reflection is to unveil what the landscape of 2050 will be like, which landscapes we desire and which we do not want. It is crucial to understand how these landscapes are built, the materials used, and their origins. By doing so, we can identify the landscapes of transformation linked to global and local contexts. How will our current urban decisions influence the future of our cities? What implications will these transformations have on the balance with nature? Are we really building a sustainable future or simply mitigating the negative effects of our unchecked urban growth? Can we create cities that are not only technologically advanced but also truly sustainable and equitable?</p>
